# Commands
These are my commands which will be updated frequently, some are for fun but some should be able to help most with their daily work.

Firstly, this is my prefix `.` which is just one period. You use this before every command that you want i.e. `.commands`

1. `.ping` --> Returns Pong! as well as information for the bot latency
2. `.8ball` --> Ask me a question and see what the magic eight ball has to say i.e. `.8ball Will I pass this class?`
3. `.yeehaw` --> I'll give you a nice big yeehaw
4. `.commands` --> List all the new commands for new users to know how to use me
